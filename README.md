### Application Description

This application allows a user to keep track of their own list of books.

The user can log in to their account and enter, edit and remove books from a database.  The user can enter the title, author, and year of publication for a book, and can view their list of books.

This repository contains the back-end code for the API portion of the application.

The front-end code can be viewed (here)[https://github.com/wcons/book-tracker-client]

### Technologies Used

1. Ruby
2. Rails framework
3. Postgresql

### Unsolved Problems

1. User ID comes back nil on book update action

### Planning Process

I originally chose a different idea, but decided to narrow my scope and keep it simple because of the project timeline.

I used the suggested schedule for the project, which was very helpful.
